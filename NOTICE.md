## section-11

Cycling Coach's **Reference** submodule (the data + sport-aware adapter
substrate that grounds coaching in verified athlete numerics) is a port of
[section-11](https://github.com/CrankAddict/section-11) by CrankAddict,
specifically protocol v11.43, released under the MIT License.

### Modifications introduced in this port

The portable Reference metrics, schemas, validation modules, top-level modules,
and concurrency primitives are canonical in `packages/kernel/src/`; Reference
sync, audit, I/O, runtime, paths, adapters, services, validation gates, and
compatibility shims remain in `packages/core/src/reference/`. The following
modifications were applied during the port:

- **Trademark substitution.** Section-11 was authored against TrainingPeaks
  vocabulary. This codebase uses intervals.icu's plain-English alternatives
  throughout — the substitution is enforced by `pnpm check:trademarks` and
  documented in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/yerzhansa/enduragent/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#trademark-hygiene).
- **Multi-sport adapter pattern.** Per ADR-0010, the Reference layer gains a
  per-sport seam — sports plug in via an optional `referenceAdapters?()`
  method on the `Sport` interface, returning an array of layer-owned adapters
  with declarative metadata plus optional algorithm hooks (e.g.,
  `computeDfa`, `computePowerCurve`). Section-11's single-sport design is
  preserved as the cycling adapter; running and duathlon compose via the
  same seam.
- **Zod-strict schemas as drift gate.** Every cache file (`latest.json`,
  `history.json`, `intervals.json`, `routes.json`, `ftp_history.json`,
  `.scheduler.json`, `error_state.json`) is parsed through a `.strict()` Zod
  schema. Forgotten-field drift fails loudly instead of silently dropping
  data; a unit test enumerates every schema and asserts strictness.
- **Mutex / cooldown discipline for sync.** A single mutex-protected
  `runSync()` orchestrates scheduled, lazy-fallback, and `/sync`-triggered
  refreshes with a 30 s acquire timeout, 2 min outer timeout, and 30 s
  per-chat cooldown. The orchestrator lives at
  `packages/core/src/reference/sync/run-sync.ts`; the underlying
  primitives (`AsyncMutex`, `chainedSignal`, `Cooldown`) are canonical in
  `packages/kernel/src/concurrency/` and are reused by future horizontal
  layers per ADR-0011.
- **Host-binding portability.** The response fingerprint used only for log
  correlation is supplied by the Node host as a synchronous SHA-256 function;
  the portable Reference layer retains no host import. This changes no metric
  or training result.
- **Three-layer validation.** Layer 1 sync gate (mechanical), Layer 2
  Zod-validated LLM output with one retry on citation mismatch, Layer 3
  prompt rules.
- **Display-units conversion at prompt-injection time.** Canonical metric on
  disk; `formatQuantity(quantity, athleteUnits)` renders to the athlete's
  preferred system. Section-11's mixed-units assumptions are removed.

## @mariozechner/pi-ai

The ChatGPT-subscription ("openai-codex") provider under
`packages/core/src/agent/codex/` — OAuth login + token refresh (`oauth.ts`),
the JWT account-id helper (`jwt.ts`), the Responses-API round-trip
(`responses.ts`), and the per-million pricing catalog (`cost.ts`) — is adapted
from [`@mariozechner/pi-ai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mariozechner/pi-ai)
v0.67.6 by Mario Zechner, distributed under the MIT License.

```

### Modifications introduced

The codex provider is not a verbatim copy; it was re-expressed in this
codebase's own type vocabulary and trimmed to what the coach needs:

- **AI-SDK types throughout.** The provider consumes/produces the Vercel AI SDK
  `ModelMessage[]` / `LanguageModelUsage` shapes used by every other provider,
  rather than pi-ai's parallel `Context` / `AssistantMessage` / `Usage` types.
  The single message↔wire conversion is folded into `responses.ts`.
- **SSE transport only.** The WebSocket transport and its session-connection
  cache are dropped; the coach collapses each reply to a single message.
- **No internal retry loop.** Retry/backoff is owned by the agent's shared
  retry primitive; the provider performs exactly one request attempt and throws
  structured errors (`httpStatus` / `retryAfterMs`, or a raw network throw with
  its errno cause) for the outer loop to classify.
- **Native token-endpoint redaction.** Failed token exchange/refresh logs only
  the HTTP status and a boolean field-presence object — never response bodies or
  token JSON. (This replaces a previously-maintained dependency patch.)
- **Client identification.** The Responses request `originator` header is
  `codex` and the `User-Agent` product token is `cycling-coach`.
- **Pricing as a static snapshot.** `cost.ts` carries a per-million price table
  for the priced providers, extracted from pi-ai's generated model catalog at
  v0.67.6; a table miss yields no cost rather than a fabricated figure.
- **Text-only message scope.** The coach is a text chat agent, so the
  message↔wire conversion handles text content only; pi-ai's `input_image`
  emission for image/file content parts (in user messages and tool results) is
  not carried over.
- **Strict tool-argument parsing.** Final tool-call arguments are parsed with a
  strict `JSON.parse` (no `partial-json` tolerant fallback). Malformed or
  truncated arguments collapse to `{}`, so the tool's own schema validation
  rejects the call cleanly rather than the model executing on a best-effort
  partial object — preferable for a write-capable coach.

## fit-file-parser

FIT decoding uses a modified copy of fit-file-parser 3.0.2, distributed under
the MIT License. The local patch corrects declared developer-field base-type
decoding, preserves occurrence identity in decoded session, lap, and record
messages, and makes CRC failures terminate; the existing flattened field-name
view is retained for compatibility.

### Modifications introduced

The Cursor paths and slash-command vocabulary were replaced with Codex project-skill paths,
`$skill-name` invocation, and `agents/openai.yaml` policy. The workflows also preserve existing
executor ownership, enforce isolated Enduragent data and process cleanup, retain privacy-scanned
evidence, and follow this repository's verification and delivery boundaries.
